# FAKE_NEWS_DETECTION

* A model that accurately classifies new articles as real or fake using ML algorithm and network analysis. ​

* Using network analysis, the system analyzes information spread through networks. ​

* Centrality measures such as degree centrality, betweenness centrality, or eigenvector centrality to identify influential nodes ​

* Can identify the communities within the network to detect potential echo chambers. ​
